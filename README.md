# C-micrograd

![awww](puppy_c.png)

[Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), but in C.

## Usage

Run `make` to compile the code. Two executables will be created inside the `./target` directory.
* `./target/example` runs the [same example](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd?tab=readme-ov-file#example-usage) as in micrograd.
* `./target/train_nn` trains an equivalent neural network to the one shown in [micrograd's demo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd?tab=readme-ov-file#training-a-neural-net).

## TODO:
Reimplement with proper memory management (no memory leaks).
